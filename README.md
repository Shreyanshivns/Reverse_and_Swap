# Reverse_and_Swap
This C++ code demonstrates a basic implementation of a singly linked list along with functionality to swap the positions of two elements within the list. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Node Class**: Defines a class `Node` representing a node in the linked list. Each node contains an integer data value and a pointer to the next node.

2. **SinglyLL Class**: Defines a class `SinglyLL` representing the singly linked list. It includes methods to display the list, insert elements, reverse the list, and swap the positions of two elements.

3. **Main Function**: 
   - Creates an instance of the `SinglyLL` class.
   - Prompts the user to enter the number of nodes in the linked list.
   - Reads the data values for each node from the user and inserts them into the linked list.
   - Displays the original list.
   - Prompts the user to enter two elements to swap.
   - Swaps the positions of the specified elements in the list.
   - Displays the modified list after swapping.

4. **Usage**: This code can be used as a starting point for understanding linked list operations in C++, such as insertion, display, and swapping elements.

5. **Note**: This code assumes that the input provided by the user is valid and does not include error handling for invalid input.

Feel free to use this code as a reference or starting point for your linked list implementation in C++.
